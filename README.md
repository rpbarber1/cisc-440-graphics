Code based on OpenGL Tutorials:  http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

Code requires many packages and is the basis for homework projects.

hw5 is the project that I did on my own using what I learned and code from other 
tutorials. 

hw5 is a simple version of Q-Bert, there is a screenshot in the output folder.
There is more info about the game in the hw5 folder.

You can't download and run the game with just these files.
You must set up your environment following the instructions in the link provided.
