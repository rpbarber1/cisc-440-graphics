Game: Simple Qbert

GAME INFO

Summary under paragraph

The game is a simplified version of Qbert. The goal is to change the color of all
the cubes to the final color. The number of colors per cube depends on the level.
Level 1 requires you jump on a cube once, level 2 means you jump on cubes twice,
etc. There are 3 levels. Each level you get 3 lives. If you run into Bad Qbert,
you will lose a life and be placed back at the top of the pyramid. The cubes will
not reset if you lose a life. If you lose all lives, the game resets to level 1.
Once you complete a level, you are reset to the top of the pyramid and all the
cube colors are reset to first color. If you beat level 3 (final level) you win
the game. You can just jump around, quit, or reset, otherwise nothing will happen.
You can't jump off the edge either.



Lives: 3 per level

Levels: 3

Don't run into bad Qbert
